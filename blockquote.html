            <h1>Flowers also known as blooms and blossoms</h1>
            <p>Flowers, also known as blooms and blossoms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants
                (angiosperms). Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. These
                include: modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male
                parts, where pollen is presented; and female parts, where pollen is received and its movement is
                facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an
                inflorescence.</p>
